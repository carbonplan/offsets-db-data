# TERMS OF DATA ACCESS

## OffsetsDB

OffsetsDB, created by CarbonPlan (https://carbonplan.org) is a regularly-updated snapshot of carbon offset projects, credit issuances, and credit retirements published by the following carbon offset registries:

- American Carbon Registry (ACR)
- ART TREES (ART)
- Climate Action Reserve (CAR)
- Gold Standard (GLD)
- Verra (VCS)

Carbon offset information has historically been scattered across multiple locations in formats that are not particularly useful to researchers. This database is meant to increase transparency, accountability, and reliability of the carbon offset market, and to provide researchers with a robust tool for visualizing, validating, and cross-checking offsets. We hope you find it useful!
