# Data Processing

## Order of Operations

OffsetsDB follows a typical extract-transform-load (ETL) workflow.
Extraction involves querying and downloading raw credit and project data hosted by offset registries.
Transformation involves executing the functions contained within this repo, `offsets-db-data`.
Load involves uploading the resulting data to S3 and the Postgres-backend that powers the OffsetsDB database tool.

## Downloading Raw Data

We download a fresh copy of project and transaction data on a daily basis.
While downloading, we make no changes to the raw data provided by the registries.
We've fully automated downloading of registry data, with the exception of Gold Standard.
Gold Standard's [terms and conditions](https://www.goldstandard.org/articles/terms-and-conditions) require that downloads occur through the interfaces provided by the Gold Standard site.
Those interfaces, as provided, do not allow automated downloads.

We have no plans to release the code the directly interacts with registries.
We decided to keep this part of OffsetsDB private in an effort to limit download requests to the registries.
Other, technical aspects of OffsetsDB, like the database and API that power the [database tool](https://carbonplan.org/research/offsets-db) are similarly closed.
We made this decision to ensure that the OffsetsDB database tool remains performant.
Critically, the production database represents an identical clone of the data generated by the code contained within `offsets-db-data`.
No additional processing or inferences should occur outside the context of this repository.

## Transforming Raw Data

Nearly the entirety of the code contained within `offsets-db-data` involves registry-specific logic for transforming raw registry data into a common, shared schema.
The logic for transforming the data of each registry is contained within a single file, with the filename denoting which registry the transformations apply to.
For example, the logic involved in transforming Verra data are contained within {py:obj}`offsets_db_data.vcs`.

Each registry-specific file contains at least two functions: `process_{registry_abbreviation}_credits` and `process_{registry_abbreviation}_projects`
Those functions, in turn, call a series of additional transformation functions that produce the normalized project and credit data which combine to form OffsetsDB.
These transformation functions tend to be quite small and operate on one or two properties of the raw data.
To continue with the Verra example, `vcs.py` contains functions with names like {py:obj}`offsets_db_data.vcs.set_vcs_vintage_year` and {py:obj}`offsets_db_data.vcs.add_vcs_project_id`.
These functions contain the registry-specific logic needed to map Verra's raw data to the common data schema of OffsetsDB.

### An Example

In practice, replicating the behavior of OffsetsDB should be simple.
Here's an example of using `offsets_db_data` to transform the raw transactions data from Verra into a normalized, analysis ready file:

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.options.display.max_columns = 5
from offsets_db_data import vcs

archive_fname = {{ path to local copy of Verra transaction data }}
raw_credits =  pd.read_csv(archive_fname)
processed_credits =  vcs.process_vcs_credits(raw_credits)
```

```{note}
Running the above example requires first downloading [a copy of Verra's transaction data](https://registry.verra.org/app/search/VCS) and changing the above code to reference the location of that data on your local machine.
```

Invoking single transformation functions, like {py:obj}`offsets_db_data.vcs.set_vcs_vintage_year` is even more straightforward.
Let's say you want to understand more about how OffsetsDB assigns Verra credits a vintage year.
You can explore the behavior of this single transformation function by calling:

```python
raw_credits.set_vcs_vintage_year(date_column='Vintage End').head()
```

It's worth noting that we've wrapped all transformation functions using the [`pandas_flavor.register_dataframe_method`](https://github.com/pyjanitor-devs/pandas_flavor) decorator.
That means that after importing a registry module from `offsets_db_data`, the transformation functions of that module are directly callable by any Pandas dataframe.

## Initial Column Mapping

The initial and perhaps must mundane transformation of OffsetsDB involves mapping properties in the raw data to a common schema.
This step requires constructing a map between the names of properties as they appear in the raw data to the property in OffsetsDB.
For example, the Climate Action Reserve data refers to the property, `project_id`, as `Project ID`.
The ART registry, however, refers to the same property as `Program ID`.

These column mapping files are stored in [`offsets_db_data/configs`](https://github.com/carbonplan/offsets-db-data/tree/main/offsets_db_data/configs).
There is a separate mapping file for `projects` data and `credits` data.
Some properties either aren't included in the raw data or inferring their value requires special processing.
In these cases, a `null` value is recorded in the column mapping files and the property is populated using registry-specific logic.

## Protocol Mapping

Offset projects are developed by following a set of rules, known as a protocol.
These rules specify things like when measurements must be made and what paperwork must be submitted in order for a project to receive credits.
Unfortunately, there is no standardized way of referring to the exact protocol (or protocol version) used to develop an offset project.
Even within the domain of a single registry, references to the exact protocol used to develop a project are often inconsistent.
Take for example the Clean Development Mechanism protocol AMS-III.D., "Methane recovery in animal manure management systems".
Across all five registries included in OffsetsDB, we identified twenty-two unique ways of referring to this one protocol.

OffsetsDB addresses this problem by manually assigning every known protocol string to a common schema.
Continuing with the AMS-III.D. example, we map all twenty-two "known strings" that describe the same protocol to a single, unified reference, `ams-iii-d`.
We repeat this manual unification of dissimilar strings for all protocols across all registries.
The results of the mapping are contained within [`offsets-db-data/configs/all-protocol-mapping.json`](https://github.com/carbonplan/offsets-db-data/blob/main/offsets_db_data/configs/all-protocol-mapping.json).

## Project Type & Categorization

In addition to unifying protocol mapping, we also assign two levels of classification to projects: `category` and `type`.
Categories represent broad classes of offset approaches, while types provide more specific information about the mitigation strategy.

### Category Assignment

Projects are assigned to one of these broad categories

- agriculture: offsets derived from changes in the management of agricultural systems, including livestock
- forest: offsets derived from the management of forests
- ghg-management: offsets derived from the destruction or elimination (e.g., substitution) of greenhouse gases
- renewable-energy: offsets derived from expanding renewable energy capacity
- energy-efficiency: offsets derived from decreasing the amount of energy required to complete a task
- fuel-switching: offsets derived from generating energy using a fuel source that produces fewer greenhouse gasses
- carbon-capture: offsets derived from technologies that capture and store carbon
- land-use: offsets derived from land management changes outside of forests
- biochar: offsets derived from biochar production and application

Category assignment is primarily determined by project type through the mapping defined in [`offsets-db-data/configs/type-category-mapping.json`](https://github.com/carbonplan/offsets-db-data/blob/main/offsets_db_data/configs/type-category-mapping.json).
This mapping connects specific project types (like "improved forest management" or "cookstoves") to their appropriate category.

### Project Type Assignment

Project types represent more specific offset approaches.
For example, within the category of "forest", projects might be classified as "improved forest management", "afforestation/reforestation", or "avoided forest conversion".

Project types are determined through a multi-step process:

1. First, we attempt to infer the project type from protocol information (via {py:obj}`offsets_db_data.projects.infer_project_type`).
2. We apply manual overrides from curated data sources (via {py:obj}`offsets_db_data.projects.override_project_types`).
   Currently, the [Berkeley Carbon Trading Project](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/research-and-impact/centers/cepp/projects/berkeley-carbon-trading-project) data in [`offsets-db-data/configs/berkeley-project-types.json`](https://github.com/carbonplan/offsets-db-data/blob/main/offsets_db_data/configs/berkeley-project-types.json) serves as the authoritative source for project types.

## Retirement User Harmonization

Carbon offset credits are often retired on behalf of a specific entity or organization.
However, the names of these retirement users are recorded inconsistently across registry data, making it difficult to analyze retirement patterns.
The following section describes our approach for identifying and harmonizing information about the end-users ("retirement users") of specific offset credits.

### Harmonization Process

The harmonization process attempts to identify specific "retirement users" from publicly disclosed retirement beneficiary information.
We try to standardize retirement user information across registries using the following steps:

1. **Data merging**: we combine information from four sources into a single _temporary_ field:

   - `retirement_beneficiary`: note specifically designating the entity claiming a credit’s environmental benefits
   - `retirement_account`: name on account from which credits were retired
   - `retirement_note`: short-form text accompanying credit retirement
   - `retirement_reason`: short form note specifying why credits were retired (e.g., compliance purposes). Sometimes similar to a retirement note

   We refer to these fields as "retirement beneficiary data."
   Any one of these fields might contain information useful for relating a transaction to a retirement user.

2. **Standardization via OpenRefine**: we process this merged information through [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) using a detailed set of transformation rules define in [`offsets-db-data/configs/beneficiary-mappings.json`](https://github.com/carbonplan/offsets-db-data/blob/main/offsets_db_data/configs/beneficiary-mappings.json). This includes:
   - text transformations that standardize common company names and entities
   - pattern matching to identify the same entities despite different formatting

Only confident matches are included in the harmonized beneficiary field, `retirement_beneficiary_harmonized`.

The retirement user harmonization process runs daily, along with the rest of OffsetsDB.
However, the underyling standardization rules (implemented via OpenRefine) are only irregularly updated.
This means that there might be new retirement data that _could_ be mapped to a known entity but, because of that mapping has not previously been described, that relationship is not reflected in OffsetsDB.
To account for this, all searches via the database tool return matches across _all available_ retirement beneficiary fields: `retirement_beneficiary`, `retirement_account`, `retirement_note`, `retirement_reason`, _and_ `retirement_beneficiary_harmonized`.
Thus, searching for known retirement users, like `Delta`, will return all records that contain the substring `delta` anywhere within their retirement beneficiary data.
Users should carefully examine these unmapped transactions to determine whether or not these unmapped records are relevant to their specific search.

### Implementation Details

Retirement user harmonization is implemented in the function {py:obj}`offsets_db_data.credits.harmonize_beneficiary_data`.
This function runs a temporary OpenRefine project using the `offsets-db-data-orcli` command-line tool (which is a wrapper around [`orcli`](https://github.com/opencultureconsulting/orcli), an OpenRefine's command-line interface) to apply the transformations defined in our mapping file.
The result is a new column, `retirement_beneficiary_harmonized`, that contains the standardized user names.

### Examples of Standardization

Our harmonization process unifies many common variations:

- "Delta Air Lines", "Delta Airlines" → "Delta Airlines"
- "Terpel", "Organizacion Terpel", "Terpel S.A." → "Terpel"
- "Retired on behalf of Sydney Opera House" → "Sydney Opera House"

### Why This Matters

Without harmonization, the same entity might appear under multiple names, making it difficult to accurately analyze which entities are retiring the most credits.
This harmonization allows for more accurate aggregation of retirement data by user.

```{note}
The harmonizaton process can be toggled on or off via the  `harmonize_beneficiary_info` parameter of the `process_{registry_abbreviation}_credits` functions.
```

## Registry Specific Transformations

Some transformations involved in producing OffsetsDB require special knowledge or assumptions about the underlying data.
This section highlights special cases.

```{note}
For additional context, consult specific function docstrings in the [API reference](api.md) or [reach out on GitHub](https://github.com/carbonplan/offsets-db-data/issues) if something doesn't make sense.
```

### American Carbon Registry

Project status: When processing ACR projects, we combine two status properties present in the raw data: `Compliance Program Status (ARB or Ecology)` and `Voluntary Status`.
For compliance projects, we report compliance program status.
For voluntary projects, we report voluntary status.

### Gold Standard

#### Planned Emission Reductions

Some Gold Standard protocols all for the issuance of "[planned emission reductions](https://goldstandardhelp.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/44001989672-what-is-a-planned-emission-reduction-per-)" (PERs).
These credits represent anticipated climate benefits that are expected to occur in the future.
PERs are issued and can be traded, but cannot be retired.
OffsetsDB includes all issued PERs when reporting vintage and project level credit totals.

### Verra

#### Issuance

Verra allows "rolling" credit issuance. This allows projects to complete the paperwork and verificaiton processes for credit issuance, but delay the actual issuance event.
This results in ambiguities around the precise timing of credit issuance events, as credits that are eligible to be issued but have not yet been issued, are not publicly reported in the Verra crediting data.
We handle this ambiguity by assuming that the first crediting event, be it an issuance, retirement, or cancellation, on a per-project, per-vintage basis results in issuance of 100 percent of credits eligible to be issued for that project-vintage.

#### Retirements vs. Cancellations

Verra's publicly available data does not distinguish between retirement events and cancellation events.
We report all Verra retirements and cancellations as `retirement`.
We originally contemplated tagging every Verra retirement or cancellation as `retirement/cancellation`.
This made our processed Verra data slightly incompatiable with data from other registries.
Simple queries, like "give me all the retirements", suddenly required writing code that look like this:

```python
credits[(credits['transaction_type'] == 'retirement') | (credits['transaction_type'] == 'retirement/cancellation')]
```

```{warning}
Because we know the majority of Verra `retirement/cancellation` events are in fact `retirement`, we opted for this more ergonomic representation of the data.
Any analysis involving Verra retirement data should clearly specify that Verra's raw data does not currently distinguish between retirement and cancellation events.
```

Vintage Date: Verra allows for the simultaneous issuance of multiple vintages.
We assign all credits from these multi-vintage issuances to the earliest reported vintage year.

### California Compliance Projects

We treat the California Air Resources Board's [issuance table](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/documents/arb-offset-credit-issuance-table) as the source of truth for all credits issued and retired by any project developed under an ARB-approved protocol.
When a project appears in the issuance table, we drop all crediting data reported from the project's host registry and _only_ report the issuance and retirement values contained within the ARB issuance table.
This methodological decision introduces a small error when it comes to "Early Action" projects.
These projects were developed during the very first phase of California's offsets program, which had slightly different rules.
After the early action phase, some projects transitioned into the full compliance program, while others did not.
Fully accounting for how these early projects retired credits, both reported by CARB's issuance table and the registries, likely requires more careful treatment.

Retirement Dates: Offsets retired for compliance with California's cap-and-trade program occur on fixed dates that correspond with the program's reporting deadlines.
These deadlines come in two forms: partial (annual) and full (triennial) compliance events.
For simplicity, the current version of OffsetsDB uses the date of the full (triennial) compliance event as the retirement date for all compliance offsets.
This means some retirement dates go unrecorded.
Specifically, compliance credits retired for _voluntary_ purposes (i.e., not to satisfy requirements under AB32) and credits retired in linked markets (e.g., Quebec) are unknown and reported as `NaT`.

## Other Normalizations

### Country

We use the Python package [coutnry_convertor](https://github.com/IndEcol/country_converter) to harmonize country names.

### Project Status

OffsetsDB unifies and simplifies project status information reported by the registries.
OffsetsDB contains use the following status codes: `listed`, `registered`, and `completed`.
Listed typically refers to the stage during which a project has been formally announced and is undergoing development, but has yet to receive credits.
Registered refers to projects that have received credits and are eligible to receive additional credits in the future.
Completed means a project previously received credits and is not currently able to receive additional credits in the future.
Many registries have far more detailed project status information, often reflecting the specific stages of the registry's validation and verification process.
Future work might focus on normalizing these additional project states across the registries.

### Credits

Credit data conform to the following schema:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "default": null,
      "title": "Id",

The majority of credit attributes are taken directly taken from the credit data downloaded from each registry.
The raw attribute names of crediting data tends to vary depending on the transaction type.
For example, ART TREES refers to retirement dates as `Status Effective`, while it reports issuances as `Date Approved`.
Rather than produce a table of each of these mappings here, please refer to [credits-raw-columns-mappings.json](https://github.com/carbonplan/offsets-db/blob/main/data/credits-raw-columns-mappings.json).
