# Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll be taking a closer look at `offsets-db-data` package, a Python package for loading and working with offsetsDB data. This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with Python and have some basic knowledge of data manipulation with pandas. You'll need to have Python 3.9 or above installed to use `offsets-db-data` package.

```{note}
If you haven't installed the package yet, please follow the instructions in the [installation guide](install-offsets-db-data.md).
```
